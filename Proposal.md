# Project Proposal by Allan Cheboiwo and Abhishek Dash

# Project Description
-We are creating a discussion forum website with predetermined categories on which users are allowed to create posts and comment on them if they create accounts. If you don't have an account, you can view posts. The categories we have so far are Politics, Health and Fitness, Sports, Entertainment, and Education.


# Functionalities
Users will be able to create posts. There will be certain rules to follow for creating posts. The user needs to have specific content, such as an image or story to post. On top of that, there should be a description and title for the post. There will be a word limit for the description and a certain level of appropriateness. 
Each category will have special users, and moderators, who will remove posts that are inappropriate and irrelevant to that category. They can also remove comments that do not follow community guidelines.
Users will be able to upvote and downvote posts. The number of downvotes will not be shown. This metric will be used to determine posts that will be put in the trending category.
The website will also sort the posts into various categories to new (newly created posts), hot (posts that are rapidly gaining likes in a category), and top(posts that have received the most likes in a given time frame). 
On the website's home page, there will be a display of trending posts from all the categories.
Users can delete their posts and comments.
Users will be able to reply to comments and share posts
